I recently bought 15 DS18B20 sensors to help someone automate their boiler room and add some fancy regulation. 
However I noticed, that I again forgot to pick up the addresses of the sensors before leaving for their house and
then going home to code. So I thought, why not make a portable DS18B20 tester, powered by a Li-Ion 18650 battery?
Well, this is exactly what came from that idea. The code works, now I am waiting for my PCBs to arrive, so I can test
them before uploading them here for everyone to use. More details soon to come along with CAD drawings and pictures.

EDIT (16. 3. 2024): 
Schematics and Gerbers are now available for viewing. Do not order PCBs yet, as the design is still untested and I 
am avaiting my first PCB batch. Feel free to check out the schematic and send me your opinion or corrections if 
you find any mistakes.
